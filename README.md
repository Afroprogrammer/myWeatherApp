## General info
An open-source weather app. Built with plain Vanilla Javascript,Html,Css and openWeatherMap api to test my JavaScript skills. I am hoping to turn it into a progressive webapp for people to install and use. Allow the app to access your location for it to get information about your longtitude and latitude to send you weather the updates.

## Screenshots
the simple Html and css used as the interface is mobile responsive to fit and display well on any given screen-size
